# Tipsy

## What I've created

I have made beautiful bill splitting, tip calculating app. No one can work out $145.56 split between 5 people with a 20 percent tip. With your very own Tipsy app in hand, I’ll never need to do maths ever again!

## What I've learned

* How to create Swift classes.
* Understand the difference between classes and structs.
* How to create multi-screen apps by learning about segues.
* Learn about advanced features of optionals, including optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
* How to use color literals to select colors from a palette.
