# Tipsy

## What I've created

I have made beautiful bill splitting, tip calculating app. No one can work out $145.56 split between 5 people with a 20 percent tip. With your very own Tipsy app in hand, Iâ€™ll never need to do maths ever again!

## What I've learned

* Create Swift Classes.
* Understand the difference between Classes and Structs.
* Create multi-screen apps by learning about segues.
* Learn about advanced features of Optionals, including Optional Binding, Optional Chaining and the Nil Coalescing Operator.
* Learn to use Color Literals to select colours from a palette.
